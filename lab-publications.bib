	abstract = {N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are of critical importance for locomotion in the developing neonatal spinal cord in rats and mice. However, due to profound changes in the expression of NMDA receptors in development between the neonatal stages and adulthood, it is unclear whether NMDA receptors are still an important component of locomotion in the adult rodent spinal cord. To shed light on this issue, we have taken advantage of recently developed preparations allowing the intracellular recording of adult motoneurons that control the tail in the sacrocaudal spinal cord of adult mice and rats. We show that in the adult sacrocaudal spinal cord, NMDA induces rhythmic activity recorded on the ventral roots, often coordinated from left to right, as in swimming motions with the tail (fictive locomotion). The adult motoneurons themselves are intrinsically sensitive to NMDA application. That is, when motoneurons are synaptically isolated with TTX, NMDA still causes spontaneous bursts of rhythmic activity, depending on the membrane potential. We show that these bursts in motoneurons depend on an NMDA-mediated persistent inward current and are terminated by the progressive activation of a persistent outward current. These results indicate that motoneurons, along with the central pattern generator, can actively participate in the production of swimminglike locomotor activity in adult rodents.},

	abstract = {Classical studies of the mammalian neuromuscular system have shown an impressive adaptation match between the intrinsic properties of motoneurons and the contractile properties of their motor units. In these studies, the rate at which motoneurons start to fire repetitively corresponds to the rate at which individual twitches start to sum, and the firing rate increases linearly with the amount of excitation ("primary range") up to the point where the motor unit develops its maximal force. This allows for the gradation of the force produced by a motor unit by rate modulation. In adult mouse motoneurons, however, we recently described a regime of firing ("subprimary range") that appears at lower excitation than what is required for the primary range, a finding that might challenge the classical conception. To investigate the force production of mouse motor units, we simultaneously recorded, for the first time, the motoneuron discharge elicited by intracellular ramps of current and the force developed by its motor unit. We showed that the motor unit developed nearly its maximal force during the subprimary range. This was found to be the case regardless of the input resistance of the motoneuron, the contraction speed, or the tetanic force of the motor unit. Our work suggests that force modulation in small mammals mainly relies on the number of motor units that are recruited rather than on rate modulation of individual motor units.},

	abstract = {The spinal motoneuron has long been a good model system for studying neural function because it is a neuron of the central nervous system with the unique properties of (1) having readily identifiable targets (the muscle fibers) and therefore having a very well-known function (to control muscle contraction); (2) being the convergent target of many spinal and descending networks, hence the name of "final common pathway"; and (3) having a large soma which makes it possible to penetrate them with sharp intracellular electrodes. Furthermore, when studied in vivo, it is possible to record simultaneously the electrical activity of the motoneurons and the force developed by their muscle targets. Performing intracellular recordings of motoneurons in vivo therefore put the experimentalist in the unique position of being able to study, at the same time, all the compartments of the "motor unit" (the name given to the motoneuron, its axon, and the muscle fibers it innervates(1)): the inputs impinging on the motoneuron, the electrophysiological properties of the motoneuron, and the impact of these properties on the physiological function of the motoneurons, i.e. the force produced by its motor unit. However, this approach is very challenging because the preparation cannot be paralyzed and thus the mechanical stability for the intracellular recording is reduced. Thus, this kind of experiments has only been achieved in cats and in rats. However, the study of spinal motor systems could make a formidable leap if it was possible to perform similar experiments in normal and genetically modified mice. For technical reasons, the study of the spinal networks in mice has mostly been limited to neonatal in vitro preparations, where the motoneurons and the spinal networks are immature, the motoneurons are separated from their targets, and when studied in slices, the motoneurons are separated from most of their inputs. Until recently, only a few groups had managed to perform intracellular recordings of motoneurons in vivo(2-4 ), including our team who published a new preparation which allowed us to obtain very stable recordings of motoneurons in vivo in adult mice(5,6). However, these recordings were obtained in paralyzed animals, i.e. without the possibility to record the force output of these motoneurons. Here we present an extension of this original preparation in which we were able to obtain simultaneous recordings of the electrophysiological properties of the motoneurons and of the force developed by their motor unit. This is an important achievement, as it allows us to identify the different types of motoneurons based on their force profile, and thereby revealing their function. Coupled with genetic models disturbing spinal segmental circuitry(7-9), or reproducting human disease(10,11), we expect this technique to be an essential tool for the study of spinal motor system.},

	abstract = {We accurately measured the conductance responsible for the afterhyperpolarization (medium AHP) that follows a single spike in spinal motoneurons of anesthetized cats. This was done by using the dynamic-clamp method. We injected an artificial current in the neurons that increased the AHP amplitude, and we made use of the fact that the intensity of the natural AHP current at the trough of the voltage trajectory was related linearly to the AHP amplitude. We determined at the same time the conductance and the reversal potential of the AHP current. This new method was validated by a simple theoretical model incorporating AHP and hyperpolarization-activated (Ih) currents and could be applied when the decay time constant of the AHP conductance was at least five times shorter than the estimated Ih activation time. This condition was fulfilled in 33 of 44 motoneurons. The AHP conductance varied from 0.3 to 1.4 microS in both slow- and fast-type motoneurons, which was approximately the same range as the input conductance of the entire population. However, AHP and input conductances were not correlated. The larger AHP in slow-type motoneurons was mainly attributable to their smaller input conductance compared with fast motoneurons. The likeness of the AHP conductance in both types of motoneurons is in sharp contrast to differences in AHP decay time and explains why slow- and fast-type motoneurons have similar gain.},

We investigated this issue in lumbar motoneurones of anaesthetized cats. Using dynamic clamp, we measured the conductance, time constant and driving force of the AHP current in a sample of motoneurones and studied how the gain was correlated to these quantities. To study the action of the AHP on the discharge variability and to compare it to its action on the gain, we injected an artificial AHP-like current in motoneurones. This increased the natural AHP. In three motoneurones, we abolished most of the natural AHP with the calcium chelator BAPTA to investigate the condition where the discharge was essentially controlled by the artificial AHP. Our results demonstrate that both the gain and the coefficient of variation of the firing rate are inversely proportional to the magnitude and to the time constant of the artificial AHP conductance. This indicates that the AHP exerts the same control over the gain and the variability. This mechanism ensures that the variability of the discharge is modulated with the gain. This guarantees a great regularity of the discharge when the motoneurone is in a low excitability state and hence good control of the force produced.},

To answer this question, we replaced the natural PICs with dynamic clamp-imposed artificial PICs at the soma of spinal motoneurons of anesthetized cats. We investigated how PICs with different kinetics (1-100 ms) amplify proprioceptive inputs. We showed that their action depends on the presence or absence of a resonance created by the I(h) current. In resonant motoneurons, a fast PIC enhances the resonance and amplifies the dynamic component of Ia inputs elicited by ramp-and-hold muscle stretches. This facilitates the recruitment of these motoneurons, which likely innervate fast contracting motor units developing large forces, e.g., to restore balance or produce ballistic movements. In nonresonant motoneurons, in contrast, a fast PIC easily triggers plateau potentials, which leads to a dramatic amplification of the static component of Ia inputs. This likely facilitates the recruitment of these motoneurons, innervating mostly slowly contracting and fatigue-resistant motor units, during postural activities. Finally, a slow PIC may switch a resonant motoneuron to nonresonant by counterbalancing I(h), thus changing the action of the fast PIC. A modeling study shows that I(h) needs to be located on the dendrites to create the resonance, and it predicts that dendritic PICs amplify synaptic input in the same manner as somatic PICs.},

To understand how this problem is solved, we performed intracellular recordings of adult mouse spinal motoneurons and investigated systematically their subthreshold properties and their discharge pattern. We show that mouse motoneurons have a much wider range of firing frequencies than cat and rat motoneurons because of three salient features. First, they have a short membrane time constant. This results in a higher cutoff frequency and a higher resonance frequency, which allow mouse motoneurons to integrate inputs at higher frequencies. Second, their afterhyperpolarization (AHP) is faster, allowing the motoneurons to discharge at a higher rate. Third, motoneurons display high-frequency (100-150 Hz) subthreshold oscillations during the interspike intervals. The fast membrane kinetics greatly favors the appearance of these oscillations, creating a "subprimary range" of firing. In this range, which has never been reported in cat and in rat spinal motoneurons, the oscillations follow the AHP and trigger spiking after a variable delay, allowing a discharge at low frequency but at the expense of an irregular rate.},

	abstract = {Since their discovery in the late 19th century our conception of motoneurons has steadily evolved. Motoneurons share the same general function: they drive the contraction of muscle fibers and are the final common pathway, i.e., the seat of convergence of all the central and peripheral pathways involved in motricity. However, motoneurons innervate different types of muscular targets. Ordinary muscle fibers are subdivided into three main subtypes according to their structural and mechanical properties. Intrafusal muscle fibers located within spindles can elicit either a dynamic, or a static, action on the spindle sensory endings. No less than seven categories of motoneurons have thereby been identified on the basis of their innervation pattern. This functional diversity has hinted at a similar diversity in the inputs each motoneuron receives, as well as in the electrical, or cellular, properties of the motoneurons that match the properties of their muscle targets. The notion of the diverse properties of motoneurons has been well established by the work of many prominent neuroscientists. But in today's scientific literature, it tends to fade and motoneurons are often thought of as a homogenous group, which develop from a given population of precursor cells, and which express a common set of molecules. We first present here the historical milestones that led to the recognition of the functional diversity of motoneurons. We then review how the intrinsic electrical properties of motoneurons are precisely tuned in each category of motoneurons in order to produce an output that is adapted to the contractile properties of their specific targets.},

	abstract = {We explain the mechanism that elicits the mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) and the subprimary firing range that we recently discovered in mouse spinal motoneurons. In this firing regime, high-frequency subthreshold oscillations appear a few millivolts below the spike voltage threshold and precede the firing of a full blown spike. By combining intracellular recordings in vivo (including dynamic clamp experiments) in mouse spinal motoneurons and modeling, we show that the subthreshold oscillations are due to the spike currents and that MMOs appear each time the membrane is in a low excitability state. Slow kinetic processes largely contribute to this low excitability. The clockwise hysteresis in the I-F relationship, frequently observed in mouse motoneurons, is mainly due to a substantial slow inactivation of the sodium current. As a consequence, less sodium current is available for spiking. This explains why a large subprimary range with numerous oscillations is present in motoneurons displaying a clockwise hysteresis. In motoneurons whose I-F curve exhibits a counterclockwise hysteresis, it is likely that the slow inactivation operates on a shorter time scale and is substantially reduced by the de-inactivating effect of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) current, thus resulting in a more excitable state. This accounts for the short subprimary firing range with only a few MMOs seen in these motoneurons. Our study reveals a new role for the AHP current that sets the membrane excitability level by counteracting the slow inactivation of the sodium current and allows or precludes the appearance of MMOs.},

	abstract = {The mouse is essential for genetic studies of motor function in both normal and pathological states. Thus it is important to consider whether the structure of motor output from the mouse is in fact analogous to that recorded in other animals. There is a striking difference in the basic electrical properties of mouse motoneurons compared with those in rats, cats, and humans. The firing evoked by injected currents produces a unique frequency-current (F-I) function that emphasizes recruitment of motor units at their maximum force. These F-I functions, however, were measured in anesthetized preparations that lacked two key components of normal synaptic input: high levels of synaptic noise and neuromodulatory inputs. Recent studies suggest that the alterations in the F-I function due to these two components are essential for recreating firing behavior of motor units in human subjects. In this study we provide the first data on firing patterns of motor units in the awake mouse, focusing on steady output in quiet stance. The resulting firing patterns did not match the predictions from the mouse F-I behaviors but instead revealed rate modulation across a remarkably wide range (10-60 Hz). The low end of the firing range may be due to changes in the F-I relation induced by synaptic noise and neuromodulatory inputs. The high end of the range may indicate that, unlike other species, quiet standing in the mouse involves recruitment of relatively fast-twitch motor units.},

	abstract = {The majority of studies on the electrical properties of neurons are carried out in rodents, and in particular in mice. However, the minute size of this animal compared with humans potentially limits the relevance of the resulting insights. To be able to extrapolate results obtained in a small animal such as a rodent, one needs to have proper knowledge of the rules governing how electrical properties of neurons scale with the size of the animal. Generally speaking, electrical resistances of neurons increase as cell size decreases, and thus maintenance of equal depolarization across cells of different sizes requires the underlying currents to decrease in proportion to the size decrease. Thus it would generally be expected that voltage-sensitive currents are smaller in smaller animals. In this study, we used in vivo preparations to record electrical properties of spinal motoneurons in deeply anesthetized adult mice and cats. We found that PICs do not scale with size, but instead are constant in their amplitudes across these species. This constancy, coupled with the threefold differences in electrical resistances, means that PICs contribute a threefold larger depolarization in the mouse than in the cat. As a consequence, motoneuronal firing rate sharply increases as animal size decreases. These differences in firing rates are likely essential in allowing different species to control muscles with widely different contraction speeds (smaller animals have faster muscle fibers). Thus from our results we have identified a possible new mechanism for how electrical properties are tuned to match mechanical properties within the motor output system.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The small size of the mouse warrants concern over whether the properties of their neurons are a scaled version of those in larger animals or instead have unique features. Comparison of spinal motoneurons in mice to cats showed unique features. Firing rates in the mouse were much higher, in large part due to relatively larger persistent inward currents. These differences likely reflect adaptations for controlling much faster muscle fibers in mouse than cat.},

	abstract = {Extra forces or torques are defined as forces or torques that are larger than would be expected from the input or stimuli, which can be mediated by properties intrinsic to motoneurons and/or to the muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine whether extra forces/torques evoked during electrical stimulation of the muscle or its nerve with variable frequency stimulation are modulated by muscle length/joint angle. A secondary aim was to determine whether extra forces/torques are generated by an intrinsic neuronal or muscle property. Experiments were conducted in 14 able-bodied human subjects and in eight adult decerebrate cats. Torque and force were measured in human and cat experiments, respectively. Extra forces/torques were evoked by stimulating muscles with surface electrodes (human experiments) or by stimulating the nerve with cuff electrodes (cat experiments). In humans and cats, extra forces/torques were larger at short muscle lengths, indicating that a similar regulatory mechanism is involved. In decerebrate cats, extra forces and length-dependent modulation were unaffected by intrathecal methoxamine injections, despite evidence of increased spinal excitability, and by transecting the sciatic nerve proximal to the nerve stimulations. Anesthetic nerve block experiments in two human subjects also failed to abolish extra torques and the length-dependent modulation. Therefore, these data indicate that extra forces/torques evoked during electrical stimulation of the muscle or nerve are muscle length-dependent and primarily mediated by an intrinsic muscle property.},

If, however, inhibition is coupled to excitation in a push-pull fashion, where inhibition decreases as excitation increases, neuron excitability can be increased. Although the presence of push-pull organization has been demonstrated in single cells, its functional impact on neural processing depends on its effect on the system level. We studied push-pull in the motor output stage of the feline spinal cord, a system that allows independent control of inhibitory and excitatory components. Push-pull organization was clearly present in ankle extensor motoneurons, producing increased peak-to-peak modulation of synaptic currents. The effect at the system level was equally strong. Independent control of the inhibitory component showed that the stronger the background of inhibition, the greater the peak force production. This illustrates the paradox at the heart of push-pull organization: increased force output can be achieved by increasing background inhibition to provide greater disinhibition.},

Interestingly, the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcysteine counteracts behavioral, electrophysical, ultrastructural and biochemical alterations in LXRdKO mice. Furthermore, Schwann cells in culture pretreated with LXR agonist, TO901317, exhibit improved defenses against oxidative stress generated by tert-butyl hydroperoxide, implying that LXRs play an important role in maintaining the redox homeostasis in the peripheral nervous system.

	abstract = {Summary Spinal motoneurons are endowed with nonlinear spiking behaviors manifested by a spike acceleration whose functional significance remains uncertain. Here, we show in rodent lumbar motoneurons that these nonlinear spiking properties do not rely only on activation of dendritic nifedipine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels, as assumed for decades, but also on the slow inactivation of a nifedipine-sensitive K+ current mediated by Kv1.2 channels that are highly expressed in axon initial segments. Specifically, the pharmacological and computational inhibition of Kv1.2 channels occluded the spike acceleration of rhythmically active motoneurons and the correlated slow buildup of rhythmic motor output recorded at the onset of locomotor-like activity. This study demonstrates that slow inactivation of Kv1.2 channels provides a potent gain control mechanism in mammalian spinal motoneurons and has a behavioral role in enhancing locomotor drive during the transition from immobility to steady-state locomotion.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1) for motor neuron circuitry and especially in spinal motor neuron (SMN) health, function, and connectivity. METHODS Since mutations in UCHL1 gene leads to motor dysfunction in patients, we investigated the role of UCHL1 on SMN survival, axon health, and connectivity with the muscle, by employing molecular and cellular marker expression analysis and electrophysiological recordings, in healthy wild-type and Uchl1 (nm3419) (UCHL1-/-) mice, which lack all UCHL1 function. RESULTS There is pure motor neuropathy with selective degeneration of the motor, but not sensory axons in the absence of UCHL1 function. Neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) are impaired in muscle groups that are innervated by slow-twitch or fast-twitch SMN. However, unlike corticospinal motor neurons, SMN cell bodies remain intact with no signs of elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. INTERPRETATION Presence of NMJ defects and progressive retrograde axonal degeneration in the absence of major SMN soma loss suggest that defining pathology as a function of neuron number is misleading and that upper and lower motor neurons utilize UCHL1 function in different cellular events. In line with findings in patients with mutations in UCHL1 gene, our results suggest a unique role of UCHL1, especially for motor neuron circuitry. SMN require UCHL1 to maintain NMJ and motor axon health, and that observed motor dysfunction in the absence of UCHL1 is not due to SMN loss, but mostly due to disintegrated circuitry.},

	abstract = {The muscle-specific kinase MuSK is one of the key molecules orchestrating neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation. MuSK interacts with the Wnt morphogens, through its Frizzled-like domain (cysteine-rich domain [CRD]). Dysfunction of MuSK CRD in patients has been recently associated with the onset of myasthenia, common neuromuscular disorders mainly characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. However, the physiological role of Wnt-MuSK interaction in NMJ formation and function remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the CRD deletion of MuSK in mice caused profound defects of both muscle prepatterning, the first step of NMJ formation, and synapse differentiation associated with a drastic deficit in AChR clusters and excessive growth of motor axons that bypass AChR clusters. Moreover, adult MuSKΔCRD mice developed signs of congenital myasthenia, including severe NMJs dismantlement, muscle weakness, and fatigability. We also report, for the first time, the beneficial effects of lithium chloride, a reversible inhibitor of the glycogen synthase kinase-3, that rescued NMJ defects in MuSKΔCRD mice and therefore constitutes a novel therapeutic reagent for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders linked to Wnt-MuSK signaling pathway deficiency. Together, our data reveal that MuSK CRD is critical for NMJ formation and plays an unsuspected role in NMJ maintenance in adulthood.},

This protocol describes the steps required to achieve a low-blood-loss decerebration in the mouse and approaches for recording signals from spinal cord neurons with a focus on motoneurons. The protocol also describes an example application for the protocol: the evocation of spontaneous and actively driven stepping, including optimization of these behaviors in decerebrate mice. The time taken to prepare the animal and perform a decerebration takes ∼2 h, and the mice are viable for up to 3-8 h, which is ample time to perform most short-term procedures.

	abstract = {Spinal motoneurons may display a variety of firing patterns including bistability between repetitive firing and quiescence and, more rarely, bistability between two firing states of different frequencies. It was suggested in the past that firing bistability required that the persistent L-type calcium current be segregated in distal dendrites, far away from the spike generating currents. However, this is not supported by more recent data. Using a two compartment model of motoneuron, we show that the different firing patterns may also result from the competition between the more proximal dendritic component of the dendritic L-type conductance and the calcium sensitive potassium conductance responsible for afterhypolarization (AHP). Further emphasizing this point, firing bistability may be also achieved when the L-type current is put in the somatic compartment. However, this requires that the calcium-sensitive potassium conductance be triggered solely by the high threshold calcium currents activated during spikes and not by calcium influx through the L-type current. This prediction was validated by dynamic clamp experiments in vivo in lumbar motoneurons of deeply anesthetized cats in which an artificial L-type current was added at the soma. Altogether, our results suggest that the dynamical interaction between the L-type and afterhyperpolarization currents is as fundamental as the segregation of the calcium L-type current in dendrites for controlling the discharge of motoneurons.},

	abstract = {In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an adult onset disease in which there is progressive degeneration of motoneurones, it has been suggested that an intrinsic hyperexcitability of motoneurones (i.e. an increase in their firing rates), contributes to excitotoxicity and to disease onset. Here we show that there is no such intrinsic hyperexcitability in spinal motoneurones. Our studies were carried out in an adult mouse model of ALS with a mutated form of superoxide dismutase 1 around the time of the first muscle fibre denervations. We showed that the recruitment current, the voltage threshold for spiking and the frequency-intensity gain in the primary range are all unchanged in most spinal motoneurones, despite an increased input conductance. On its own, increased input conductance would decrease excitability, but the homeostasis for excitability is maintained due to an upregulation of a depolarizing current that is activated just below the spiking threshold. However, this homeostasis failed in a substantial fraction of motoneurones, which became hypoexcitable and unable to produce sustained firing in response to ramps of current. We found similar results both in lumbar motoneurones recorded in anaesthetized mice, and in sacrocaudal motoneurones recorded in vitro, indicating that the lack of hyperexcitability is not caused by anaesthetics. Our results suggest that, if excitotoxicity is indeed a mechanism leading to degeneration in ALS, it is not caused by the intrinsic electrical properties of motoneurones but by extrinsic factors such as excessive synaptic excitation.},

	abstract = {After spinal cord injury (SCI), reflexes become hyperexcitable, leading to debilitating muscle spasms and compromised motor function. Previous work has described adaptations in spinal systems that might underlie this hyperexcitability, including an increase in constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors in spinal motoneurons. That work, however, examined adaptations following complete transection SCI, whereas SCI in humans is usually anatomically and functionally incomplete. We therefore evaluated whether constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptors contributes to reflex hyperexcitability in an incomplete compression model of SCI and to spasms in vitro and in vivo. Our results confirm that 5-HT2C receptor constitutive activity contributes to reflex excitability after incomplete SCI. We also evaluated whether constitutive activity could be altered by manipulation of neural activity levels after SCI, testing the hypothesis that it reflects homeostatic processes acting to maintain spinal excitability. We decreased neural activity after SCI by administering baclofen and increased activity by administering the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. We found that drug administration produced minimal alterations in in vivo locomotor function or reflex excitability. Similarly, we found that neither baclofen nor fluoxetine altered the contribution of constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors to reflexes after SCI, although the contribution of 5-HT2C receptors to reflex activity was altered after SSRIs. These results confirm the importance of constitutive activity in 5-HT2C receptors to spinal hyperexcitability following SCI in the clinically relevant case of incomplete SCI but suggest that this activity is not driven by homeostatic processes that act to maintain overall levels of spinal excitability.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY After spinal cord injury (SCI), most people will develop muscle spasms below their level of injury that can severely impact function. In this work, we examine the adaptations that occur within the spinal cord after SCI that contribute to these motor dysfunctions. We also evaluate one hypothesis about how these adaptations develop, which will potentially lead to intervention strategies to improve functional outcomes in persons with SCI.},

We tested this hypothesis in vivo in two unrelated ALS mouse models by correlating the electrical properties of motoneurons with their physiological types, identified based on their motor unit contractile properties. We found that, far from being hyperexcitable, the most vulnerable motoneurons become unable to fire repetitively despite the fact that their neuromuscular junctions were still functional.

	abstract = {Excessive excitation is hypothesized to cause motoneuron (MN) degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but actual proof of hyperexcitation in vivo is missing, and trials based on this concept have failed. We demonstrate, by in vivo single-MN electrophysiology, that, contrary to expectations, excitatory responses evoked by sensory and brainstem inputs are reduced in MNs of presymptomatic mutSOD1 mice. This impairment correlates with disrupted postsynaptic clustering of Homer1b, Shank, and AMPAR subunits. Synaptic restoration can be achieved by activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, by either intracellular injection of cAMP or DREADD-Gs stimulation. Furthermore, we reveal, through independent control of signaling and excitability allowed by multiplexed DREADD/PSAM chemogenetics, that PKA-induced restoration of synapses triggers an excitation-dependent decrease in misfolded SOD1 burden and autophagy overload. In turn, increased MN excitability contributes to restoring synaptic structures. Thus, the decrease of excitation to MN is an early but reversible event in ALS. Failure of the postsynaptic site, rather than hyperexcitation, drives disease pathobiochemistry.},

	abstract = {Although ALS is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease, motoneuron electrical properties are already altered during embryonic development. Motoneurons must therefore exhibit remarkable capacity for homeostatic regulation to maintain a normal motor output for most of the life of the patient. In the present paper, we demonstrate how maintaining homeostasis could come at a very high cost. We studied the excitability of spinal motoneurons from young adult SOD1(G93A) mice to end-stage. Initially homeostasis is highly successful in maintaining their overall excitability. This initial success, however, is achieved by pushing some cells far above the normal range of passive and active conductances. As the disease progresses, both passive and active conductances shrink below normal values in the surviving cells. This shrinkage may thus promote survival, implying the previously large values contribute to degeneration. These results support the hypothesis that motoneuronal homeostasis may be “hyper-vigilant” in ALS, and a source of accumulating stress.},
