 abstract = {Appropriate scaling of motor output from mouse to humans is essential. The motoneurons that generate all motor output are, however, very different in rodents compared with humans, being smaller and much more excitable. In contrast, feline motoneurons are more similar to those in humans. These scaling differences need to be taken into account for the use of rodents for translational studies of motor output.},
