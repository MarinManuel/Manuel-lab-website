We are a research group in the [Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences](https://web.uri.edu/pharmacy/bps/) at the University of Rhode Island, College of Pharmacy.

Our main focus of research is the workings of the motor system and how the normal motor function is affected in pathological conditions. To this end, we use *in vivo* electrophysiology, *in vitro* electrophysiology, viral approaches, and imaging.

**We are hiring!** If you are interested in the spinal cord and electrophysiology, please [get in touch](/contact)
